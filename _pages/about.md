I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Information Science at Drexel University. I received my PhD from the University of Washington’s iSchool in 2023 and an MS in Computer Engineering from Virginia Tech. My research sits at the intersection of HCI, CSCW, and social computing, and examines how people make sense of, and navigate, evolving social phenomena such as magical thinking, social mobility, community formation, and collective uncertainty. I study these dynamics through computational and large-scale analyses of online platforms, focusing on how sociotechnical systems shape everyday meaning-making and social life.


I am happy to work with undergraduate and master's students on research co-op or in volunteer research positions. If you would like to collaborate, please email me your CV along with a brief description of your research or project interests.
