  <div class="course-name">INFO 615: Designing with Data (Masters)</div>
  <div class="course-department">Information Science</div>
  <div class="course-description">
Although user experience design has always involved collecting data about users’ needs and preferences, new forms and quantities of user data have created a need for new data analysis skills and professional ethics training among designers. This class introduces students to A/B testing and statistical methods to prepare them to design and run large scale user experiments that can inform design decisions. Students practice using tools and methods as well as composing experiment reports and design recommendations.
